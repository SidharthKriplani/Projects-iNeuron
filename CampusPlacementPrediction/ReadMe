Student placement is one of the most important objectives of an educational institution. Reputation of an institution as well as its yearly admissions invariably depend on the placements its students are able to secure for themselves. That is why all the institutions, arduously, strive to strengthen their placement department so as to improve their institution on a whole. Any assistance in this particular area will have a positive impact on an institutionâ€™s ability to place its students. This will always be helpful to both the students, as well as the institution. The main goal is to predict whether the student will be placed in campus placement opportunities or not based on the available factors in the dataset.
